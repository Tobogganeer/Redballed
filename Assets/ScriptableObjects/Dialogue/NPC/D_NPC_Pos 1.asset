  - "Hey, I wasn\u2019t expecting this so early! You guys sure are efficient."
  - "I bet you didn\u2019t even collect any red balls on the way here hahaha."
  - Oh you did? Bah! I bet I could collect more than you did.
  - "I\u2019m something of a red ball expert myself."
  - Not to brag or anything, but I once got the daily record, it was over 80!
  - "I don\u2019t spend as much time outside as I\u2019d like to, but believe me
    if I was out there, you\u2019d be wondering where they all went."
  - Anyways, thank you, and take it easy!
