  - "I only ordered this yesterday, how is it already here? You\u2019re a fast runner
    I guess."
  - "Oh I know, you also don\u2019t waste time collecting those red balls."
  - Finally someone else with a brain!
  - "Those red balls are evil and I\u2019ve been trying to tell people for ages but
    they don\u2019t listen."
  - "They\u2019re a big plot by the government to keep us in line, I\u2019m not falling
    for it. That\u2019s why I stay at home so much!"
  - That aside, thank you again for delivering this, and keep up the good work.
